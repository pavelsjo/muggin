mugging

One fundamental step in the Big Data analysis is the preprocessing data, because, 
in the real world the data usually can be containing many errors as null values, outliers, duplicated data, ..., 
so with this library you can do some data frames to practice your mugging techniques using any program language, 
programs, spreadsheets, etc, and later you can compare the messy data to solution with your results.
